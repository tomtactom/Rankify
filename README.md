# Rankify

Rankify is a PHP-based web tool that helps you prioritize options through pairwise comparisons.
Users rank items from predefined card sets. The application calculates scores using different
models (e.g. Thurstone, Bradleyâ€“Terry) and presents an ordered list of your preferences.

## Features
* Simple pairwise comparison interface
* Multiple statistical models
* Profile page showing your last results
* Export results as APA text, JSON, PNG or PDF

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure PHP 8+ is installed.
3. Run a local server with `php -S localhost:8000` in the project directory.
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

No database is required; results are stored locally in the browser.

### Maintenance
Confirmation links generated through the contact form are stored in `data/contact`.
Run `php scripts/cleanup_tokens.php` periodically (e.g. daily via cron) to remove
expired tokens.
